      "answer": "COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19). Seasonal allergies triggered by airborne pollen can lead to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which affects the nose and sinuses, and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, which affects the eyes.\n\nCOVID-19 and seasonal allergies share many symptoms, but there are some key differences between the two. For example, COVID-19 can cause fever, which is not a common symptom of seasonal allergies. The image below compares symptoms caused by allergies and COVID-19.\n\nBecause some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal allergies are similar, it may be difficult to tell the difference between them, and you may need to get a test to confirm your diagnosis\n\n[508 version](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/infographic-overlap-symptoms.html)\n\n**Seasonal allergies do not usually cause shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, unless a person has a respiratory condition such as asthma that can be triggered by exposure to pollen.*\n\nThis is not a complete list of all possible symptoms of COVID-19 or seasonal allergies. Symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. You can have symptoms of both COVID-19 and seasonal allergies at the same time.\n\nIf you think you have COVID-19, follow CDC’s guidance on \n[”What to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html)\n\n.” \n\n**If you have **\n[**an emergency warning sign**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#seek-medical-attention)\n\n** (including trouble breathing), seek emergency medical care immediately.**\n\nGet more information on [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), or more information on [seasonal allergy symptoms](https://www.aafa.org/rhinitis-nasal-allergy-hayfever/).",

      "answer": "The best way to protect yourself against seasonal allergies is to reduce your exposure to pollen. During high pollen days:\n\n*   Limit your time outdoors and seek indoor spaces with clean air.\n\n*   Create a cleaner air space at home to protect yourself from outdoor air irritants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use a portable air cleaner in one or more rooms. Portable air cleaners work best when run continuously with doors and windows closed. [Do-it-yourself box fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukyF2xm8cws&feature=youtu.be) filtration units are a low-cost filtration alternative, but they should never be left unattended.\n\n*   Keep your cleaner air space a comfortable temperature by using air conditioners, heat pumps, fans, and window shades.\n\n*   If you have a forced air system in your home, consult a qualified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professional about different filters (HEPA or MERV-13 or higher) and settings (“Recirculate” and “On” rather than “Auto”) that can be used to reduce indoor air irritants.\n\n*   If outdoors, avoid activities that stir up pollen, such as mowing lawns or raking leaves. When you return indoors, take a shower and change your clothes.\n\nThe EPA website on [indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) and the [EPA Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf) provide additional information on improving indoor air quality.

Por lo general, los overoles ofrecen 360 grados de protección porque están diseñados para cubrir todo el cuerpo, incluso la espalda y la parte inferior de las piernas. Algunas veces, también cubren la cabeza y los pies. Esta cobertura adicional podría ser necesaria para ciertas tareas laborales que conlleva el transporte médico. Sin embargo, los overoles pueden generar mayor estrés por calor que las batas debido al área total que cubre la tela. La capacitación sobre cómo quitarse correctamente un overol es importante para prevenir el autocontagio. En comparación, las batas son más fáciles de ponerse y, en particular, de quitarse.",

Los respiradores N95 son respiradores de ajuste hermético que filtran al menos el 95 % de las partículas en el aire, incluidas las grandes y las pequeñas.\n\n*   No todos pueden usar un respirador debido a afecciones que podrían empeorar cuando se respira a través de él. Antes de usar respirador o hacer la prueba de ajuste, los trabajadores deben tener una evaluación médica para asegurarse de que puedan usarlo en forma segura.\n\n*   Es esencial lograr un ajuste adecuado a la cara. La reglamentación de los Estados Unidos exige que los trabajadores se sometan a pruebas de ajuste anuales y que se verifique el sellado cada vez que se use el respirador. Los trabajadores deben aprobar una prueba de ajuste para confirmar el sellado adecuado antes de usar un respirador en el lugar de trabajo.\n\n*   Cuando se coloca y usa correctamente, el escape es mínimo alrededor de los bordes del respirador cuando el usuario inhala. Esto significa que casi todo el aire es dirigido a través del material del filtro.\n\n*   A diferencia de los respiradores N95 aprobados por NIOSH, las mascarillas tienen un ajuste flojo y brindan solo una barrera protectora contra gotitas, incluidas las partículas respiratorias grandes. Con las mascarillas no es necesario realizar ninguna prueba de ajuste ni control del sellado. La mayoría de las mascarillas no filtran eficazmente las partículas pequeñas del aire y no previenen el escape alrededor del borde de la mascarilla cuando el usuario inhala.\n\n*   La función de las mascarillas es el control de la fuente del paciente, prevenir la contaminación de la zona circundante cuando una persona tose o estornuda. Los pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado deben usar una mascarilla hasta que estén aislados en un hospital o en el hogar. El paciente no necesita usar una mascarilla mientras está aislado.",

      "answer": "One important strategy that administrators can consider is cohorting (or forming “pods”). [Cohorting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html) forms groups of students, and sometimes teachers or staff, that stay together throughout the school day to minimize exposure for students, teachers, and staff across the school environment.Ideally, students and staff within a cohort would only have physical proximity with others in the same cohort. This practice may help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by limiting cross-over of students, teachers, and staff to the extent possible, thus:\n\n*   decreasing opportunities for exposure to or transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\n\n*   facilitating more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case, and\n\n*   allowing for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single cohort instead of school-wide measures in the event of a positive case or cluster of cases.[Cohorting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html) can be done as part of a traditional model with all students attending school in-person, on a full-time basis, or as part of a of a hybrid school model (i.e., students attending in-person school on an alternating schedule). Different strategies may be needed for elementary, middle, and high schools. [Cohorting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html) is a commonly used strategy in many elementary schools, in which students have the same teacher and classmates during the entire day and often for the entire school year. Implementation of this strategy varies, depending on setting and resources. For example, schools may keep cohorts together in one classroom, and have teachers rotate between cohorts. Alternatively, schools may assign student cohorts to specific days or weeks for in-person and online learning.",

However, CDC modeling demonstrates that smaller cohort sizes are generally associated with less transmission in schools. Smaller cohorts means more limited contacts, but there is no specific threshold for optimal size. Even with smaller groups, cohorts may not be truly independent of one another. Families may have children of different ages (i.e., siblings) who act as connections between cohorts within a school. Teachers, especially with specialized expertise, may also connect multiple cohorts within a school because their expertise is used/needed across cohorts. Use of masks and distancing when possible are particularly important when teachers are moving amongst groups of students.\n[Cohorting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html)\n\n may be implemented as one of a variety of mitigation strategies that schools can use to help minimize SARS-CoV-2\n\ntransmission.

      "answer": "An alternating schedule is when students rotate when they physically attend school. This is also sometimes called a hybrid schedule (mix of in-person and virtual school). For example, certain grades or classrooms may attend school on Monday and Tuesday while other grades or classrooms may attend on Thursday and Friday. The school would be thoroughly cleaned on Wednesday. As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation.2CDC is currently examining different alternating scheduling durations and strategies to assess their potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in school. Preliminary modeling results suggest that - similar to [cohorting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html) - alternating schedules can help reduce contact between students and staff, and both alternating days and alternating weeks of in-person instruction have the potential to reduce in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 compared with daily in-person instruction. While alternating schedules may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, there may be additional costs related to lesson planning for teachers, childcare costs for parents, and other potential costs. More research is needed on the layered impact of alternating schedules with other SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, masks, proper hygiene, and cohorting) as well as the impact of alternating schedules on students’ learning and well-being.",

These changes have included reducing class sizes, increasing physical distance between students, and cohorting. Many countries have staggered attendance and their start and dismissal times, or they have created alternating shifts of students to enable social distancing. In some places, this approach has meant that only certain students have returned to in-person learning, either by varying grades attending in-person, or varying attendance by need. For example:\n\n    *   Denmark was the first European country to reopen schools. Denmark staggered students’ reentry dates (e.g., one group started school first, followed by another group at a later date). Denmark limited class sizes and used other social distancing measures.1 Younger students (under age 12) returned first based on their likely lower health risk, need for more supervision, and lower benefit from virtual learning compared to older students. Class sizes were reduced to allow physical distancing. Denmark has seen decreased infections among all age groups since schools reopened.3\n    *   In comparison to Denmark, Germany reopened for older students with students attending in alternating shifts to ensure a maximum class size of 10.2",

      "answer": "If law enforcement personnel have direct personal contact with an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, they should immediately use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, or [wash hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth. Any uniform items (or other surfaces) that were potentially exposed should be disinfected or cleaned as soon as feasible. For example, the duty belt or other non-porous items can be disinfected using products that are [EPA-approved for use against the virus](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2). Porous items, like the uniform, should be replaced as soon as possible and then laundered according to manufacturers’ recommendations. This is especially important if any body fluids were expelled during the encounter (bloodborne pathogen protocols should also be followed if applicable). Gloves should be worn when touching potentially contaminated items or applying disinfectants and it is important to perform hand hygiene upon removing gloves or other PPE.Law enforcement personnel who have an exposure should be evaluated by their occupational health program and may be able to finish their work shift before starting home isolation.If personnel and resources are available, it is most protective for law enforcement personnel to [stay at home until 14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health-recommendations.html) after exposure to an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the exposure was prolonged (10 minutes or more) or if the exposure was of concern (e.g., the individual coughed into the face of the law enforcement officer). This would best protect the health of the exposed worker, their co-workers, and the general public.The best way to protect yourself and others is to [stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html).

To continue working, the exposed worker should remain symptom-free, and the employer should put into place the following [prevention strategies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html) for the exposed worker:\n\n*   Screen the worker for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before each work shift\n\n*   Regularly monitor the worker for symptoms, under the supervision of an occupational health program\n\n*   Ensure the worker practices social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet away from others)\n\n*   Ensure the worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemasks are unavailable) to protect othersIf an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath)  and is still working, the employer should:\n\n*   Send the worker home immediately and encourage them to follow CDC guidance for [What to Do If You Are Sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html).\n\n*   [Clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html) surfaces in their workspace.\n\n*   Follow CDC guidance to determine when the worker can [return to work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html).For more information, see CDC’s updated guidance for [Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html).",

A committee of both employees and management may be the most effective way to recognize all of these scenarios.It is important to note that control recommendations or interventions assigned to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task.Approaches to consider may include the following:Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nMake sure the workspace is [well-ventilated](https://www.ashrae.org/news/ashraejournal/guidance-for-building-operations-during-the-covid-19-pandemic).Change the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so employees are not facing each other.Consider making foot traffic one-way in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\n\nSet up, where possible, physical barriers between employees, and between employees and customers.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.Move electronic payment terminals/credit card readers farther away from the cashier to increase the distance between the customer and the cashier.\n\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind employees to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nConsider these cues for customers as well, such as at the entrance or checkout line.\n\nPlace handwashing stations or \n[hand sanitizers](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/hand-sanitizer-use.html)\n\n with at least 60% alcohol throughout the workplace for employees and customers.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.Make sure restrooms are well-stocked with soap and paper towels.\n\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n*   All employees should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, [how the disease spreads](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html), [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), and ways to prevent or minimize the spread.\n\n*   Trainings should cover the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet), [wearing cloth face coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) appropriately, [covering coughs and sneezes](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html), [washing hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), [cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html), not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching the face, mouth, or eyes.\n\n*   Employees should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick.

To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why administrative and engineering controls are emphasized in guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the current pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N-95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare employees and other medical first responders, as recommended by current \n[CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html)\n\n unless they were required for the job before the pandemic.",

      "answer": "Screening employees is an optional strategy that employers may use. Performing screening or health checks will not be completely effective because asymptomatic individuals or individuals with mild non-specific symptoms may not realize they are infected and may pass through screening. Screening and health checks are not a replacement for other protective measures such as social distancing.Consider encouraging individuals planning to enter the workplace to self-screen prior to coming onsite and not to attempt to enter the workplace if any of the following are present:\n\n*   [Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html) of COVID-19\n\n*   Fever equal to or higher than 100.4oF*\n\n*   Are under evaluation for COVID-19 (for example, waiting for the results of a viral test to confirm infection)\n\n*   Have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and not yet cleared to discontinue isolation\n\n*A lower temperature threshold (e.g., 100.0\no\n\nF) may be used, especially in healthcare settings.\n\n**Content of screening questions**\n\nIf you decide to actively screen employees for symptoms rather than relying on self-screening, consider which symptoms to include in your assessment. Although there are \n[many different symptoms that may be associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)\n\n, you may not want to treat every employee with a single non-specific symptom (e.g., a headache) as a suspect case of COVID-19 and send them home until they meet \n[criteria for discontinuation of isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html)\n\n.Consider focusing the screening questions on “new” or “unexpected” symptoms (e.g., a chronic cough would not be a positive screen). Consider including these symptoms:\n\n*   Fever or feeling feverish (chills, sweating)\n\n*   New cough\n\n*   Difficulty breathing\n\n*   Sore throat\n\n*   Muscle aches or body aches\n\n*   Vomiting or diarrhea\n\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n\n**Protection of screeners**\n\nThere are several methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the screening. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize the screener’s exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider that incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:\n\n**Reliance on Social Distancing:**\n\n Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and:\nAsk the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C) and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.Screening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\n**Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls:**\n\n During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then:\nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.Conduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol:\n\n*   Put on disposable gloves.\n\n*   Check the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.\n\n*   **If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.** If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.Remove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n\nIf social distance or barrier controls cannot be implemented during screening, PPE can be used when the screener is within 6 feet of an employee during screening. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement given PPE shortages and training requirements.\n**Reliance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): **Upon arrival, the screener should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with an employee is anticipated. Then:\n\n*   Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue, and confirm that the employee is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\n\n*   Take the employee’s temperature.\n\n    *   **If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check**. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, you should clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.\n\n*   After each screening or after several screenings, where you did not have physical contact with an individual, remove and discard PPE and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.",

      "answer": "**Upper-room GUV**\n\nUpper-room (or upper-air) GUV uses specially designed GUV fixtures mounted on walls or ceilings to create a disinfection zone of ultraviolet (UV) energy that is focused up and away from people. These fixtures disinfect air as it circulates from mechanical ventilation, ceiling fans, or natural air movement. The advantage of upper-room GUV is that it disinfects the air closer to and above people who are in the room. Since the 1980s, GUV systems have been widely used for control of tuberculosis (TB). The CDC guidance \n[Environmental Control for Tuberculosis: Basic Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Guidelines for Healthcare Settings](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-105/pdfs/2009-105.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2009105)\n\n provides information on appropriate GUV system design, related safe operation, and maintenance. Based on data from other human coronaviruses, a GUV system designed to protect against the spread of TB should be effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and therefore prevent spread. GUV systems usually require a few GUV fixtures to be effective. For example, a rectangular-shaped waiting room with 10–30 occupants will require 2–3 upper-air GUV fixtures. Of note, the potential for reflection of UV energy into the lower occupied space is a potential safety concern with upper-room GUV systems. However, a reputable GUV manufacturer or an experienced GUV system designer should know the precautionary techniques to prevent harmful UV exposures to people in the space. [\n\n**Potential Application:**\n\n Can be used in any indoor environment; most useful in spaces highly occupied with people who are or may be sick.]\n\n**In-Duct GUV**\n\nIn-duct GUV systems are installed within a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. These systems are designed to serve one of two purposes:\n**Coil treatment GUV** keeps HVAC coils, drain pans, and wetted surfaces free of microbial growth. These devices produce relatively low levels of UV energy. This energy is continually delivered 24 hours a day, which is why they are effective. Coil treatment GUV devices are not designed for disinfecting the air and should not be installed for the purpose of air disinfection. [**Potential Application:** Can be used to reduce HVAC maintenance and improve operational efficiency within large, commercial HVAC systems or residential HVAC systems; not recommended for inactivating airborne pathogens.]**Air disinfection GUV** systems can be effective at inactivating airborne pathogens as they flow within the HVAC duct. HVAC air disinfection GUV systems generally require more powerful UV lamps or a greater number of lamps, or both, to provide the necessary GUV required to inactivate pathogens in a short period of time. Air disinfection systems are often placed downstream of the HVAC coils. This location keeps the coil, drain pan, and wetted surfaces free of microbial growth and also disinfects the moving air. [**Potential Application:** Can be used inside any HVAC system to disinfect infectious airborne pathogens.]\n\n**Far-UV (or Far-UVC)**\n\nFar-UV is one of many emerging technologies that have become popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. While standard GUV fixtures emit UV energy at a wavelength around 254 nanometers (nm), far-UV devices use different lamps to emit UV energy at a wavelength around 222 nm. Aside from the wavelength, a major difference between the two technologies is that standard GUV systems are specifically designed to avoid exposing people to the UV energy, while many far-UV devices are marketed as safe for exposing people and their direct environment to UV energy. A review of peer-reviewed literature indicates that far-UV wavelengths can effectively inactivate microorganisms, including human coronaviruses, when appropriate UV doses are applied. Questions remain about the mechanisms of killing microorganisms and overall safety. Far-UV might prove to be effective at disinfecting air and surfaces, without some of the safety precautions required for standard GUV. Far-UV devices are best viewed as new and emerging technology. [\n\n**Potential Application**\n\n: Yet to be determined.] Consumers considering an emerging technology such as Far-UV can research the proposed system. Ask the vendor to provide proof of effectiveness and performance that demonstrates a clear protective benefit. Engage with a ventilation engineer, and if the engineer recommends installing such a system, obtain a guarantee as to expected disinfection performance. When evaluating evidence of system effectiveness, place emphasis on research publications over anecdotal claims and consider the following questions:\nAre there independent studies that prove the desired performance of the technology?Did the study environments represent your environment and intended use?Have performance results been published in a scientific or medical journal?Was the technology evaluated for potential adverse health effects or occupational exposures?Where is the technology being used?",

      "answer": "The risk of spreading the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through ventilation systems is not well-known at this time. Viral RNA has reportedly been found on return air grilles, in return air ducts, and on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters, but detecting viral RNA alone does not imply that the captured virus was capable of transmitting disease. One research group reported that the use of a new air-sampling method allowed them to find [viable viral particles within a COVID-19 patient’s hospital room](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1201971220307396?token=A64023F619182536348B84545098F44BA3B0B91F7A184BDFC88800C083DBFAF8758ABBCA9AE879B9209E9678D2272A85) with good ventilation, filtration and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection (at distances as far as 16 feet from the patient). However, the concentration of viable virus detected was believed to be too low to cause disease transmission. There may be some implications for HVAC systems associated with these findings, but it is too early to conclude that with certainty. While airflows within a particular space may help spread disease among people in that space, there is no evidence to date that viable virus has been transmitted through an HVAC system to result in disease transmission to people in other spaces served by the same system.Healthcare facilities have ventilation requirements in place to help prevent and control infectious diseases that are associated with healthcare environments. For more information, see the CDC [Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/index.html).Non-healthcare (businesses and schools) building owners and managers should maintain building ventilation systems according to state/local building codes and applicable guidelines. Ensuring appropriate outdoor air and ventilation rates is a practical step building owners and managers can take to ensure good indoor air quality.

      "answer": "While large droplets (100 micrometers [µm] and larger) will settle to surrounding surfaces within seconds, smaller particles can stay suspended in the air for much longer. It can take several minutes for particles 10 µm in size to settle, while particles 5 µm and smaller may not settle for hours or even days. Dilution ventilation and particle filtration are commonly used to remove these smaller particles from the air. Larger particles can also be removed using these strategies, but since they fall out of the air quickly, they might not have a chance to get captured by filtration systems. The time required to remove airborne particles from a space can be estimated once the source of infectious particles is no longer present and the dilution air is free of new infectious particles (e.g. it is uncontaminated supply air or it is the clean exhaust from a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) fan/filtration system [See HEPA filtration discussion below]). \n[Table B.1](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html)\n\n in the CDC’s \n[Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/index.html)\n\n (2003) provides estimates of the time required to remove airborne contaminants, including airborne viral particles, from the air through ventilation dilution, exhaust and filtration. The table provides estimates of the time required for airborne-contaminant removal based upon the room’s ventilation rate, measured in air changes per hour (ACH) and the desired removal efficiency (99% or 99.9%).Although there are some highly contagious airborne diseases (like measles) where CDC provides specific guidance for 99.9% clearance wait times, the general recommendation in CDC’s \n[Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/index.html)\n\n is to wait to allow for a 99% reduction of any generated airborne particles before re-entering the room. In the absence of specific guidance specifying a longer wait period for the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the wait time associated with 99% clearance is appropriate for healthcare and other spaces. Regardless of whether the 99% or 99.9% column on \n[Table B.1](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html)\n\n is used, the value in the table is usually an under-estimation of the actual dilution clearance time as noted in the table’s footnotes which include the following statement: “The times given assume perfect mixing of the air within the space (i.e., mixing factor = 1). However, perfect mixing usually does not occur. Removal times will be longer in rooms or areas with imperfect mixing or air stagnation.” Appropriate use of Table B.1 to establish clearance times from any space requires multiplying the time in the table by a mixing factor (k) that ranges between 1 and 10. This factor represents how well the ventilation system mixes and dilutes the concentration of airborne particles within the room. As a rule of thumb, rooms with higher airflow rates (6 ACH and higher) and good placement of supply and exhaust grilles (hospital airborne infection isolation rooms) are considered to have “good” mixing and thus a mixing factor of k = 3 is often used for these spaces. In that case, the time identified from Table B.1 should be multiplied by 3 in order to determine the actual clearance time prior to re-entry.  Nonventilated or poorly ventilated spaces have typical values of k ranging from 8 to 10. Increased ACH generally leads to reductions in k, although k can also be reduced by the use of a fan in the space, which does not have an impact on ACH.  Ultimately, wait times can be reduced by increasing ACH, reducing k, or a combination of both.\n**[]()Example 1**\n\n: A room measuring 12 feet x 10 feet with a ceiling height of 9 feet is served with a 100% outdoor air ventilation system that delivers 65 cubic feet per minute (cfm) of supply air (Q\ns\n\n = 65 cfm) and exhausts 72 cfm of air from the room (Q\ne\n\n = 72 cfm). The room has average air mixing, so assign k = 5. How much time is required to reduce the airborne particle concentration by 99 percent?Since Q\ne\n\n is larger than Q\ns\n\n by 7 cfm, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is pulling 7 cfm of air into the room from adjacent areas (i.e., the room is under negative pressure). For this example, the 7 cfm of transfer air is assumed to be free of infectious airborne particles. The clean volumetric air flow rate (Q) is the larger value between Q\ns\n\n and Q\ne\n\n, so Q = 72 cfm. Now, calculate the air changes per hour:ACH = [Q x 60] / (room volume) = (72 cfm x 60) / (12’ x 10’ x 9’) = 4320/1080 = 4.0 ACHUsing \n[Table B.1](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html)\n\n the perfect mixing wait time based on 4 ACH and a 99% reduction of airborne particles is 69 minutes.Using the mixing factor of 5, the estimated wait time for 99% reduction of airborne contaminants in the room is 5 x 69 = 345 minutes or \n5 hours and 45 minutes.\n\n**Note:  **\n\nDetermining the true value of the mixing factor is difficult and requires special equipment to measure air flows and conduct tracer gas decay testing. Thus, conservative estimates of k are often used (as described above).  Also, the addition of an air cleaning device (e.g., a portable HEPA filtration unit) within the same room will reduce the wait time.  The flow rate from the air cleaning device can be added to Q determined above, which will increase the overall ACH in the room.  The air movement created by the air cleaning device can also decrease the value of k.  Together, the increased ACH and decreased k can help substantially reduce wait times. See \n[Example 2](#refex2)\n\n for more information, including an example of the calculations.",

      "answer": "Filters for use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are generally tested under procedures outlined in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 52.2-2017-Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal Efficiency by Particle Size. To access the standard, the end user typically must purchase it, but ASHRAE, which is a global society focused on building systems, indoor air quality, and sustainability in the built environment, has made it available for [free online viewing](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/ashrae-standards-and-guidelines) during the ongoing pandemic. Based on the filtration efficiency determined by the testing procedures, filters are assigned a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV). The MERV provides a measure of the “filter efficiency” over the range of particle sizes prescribed in the test procedure. MERV values range from 1 to 16 and higher MERV values correspond to more efficient filters.Research shows that the particle size of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is around 0.1 micrometer (µm). However, the virus generally does not travel through the air by itself. These viral particles are human-generated, so the virus is trapped in respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei (dried respiratory droplets) that are larger than an individual virus. Most of the respiratory droplets and particles exhaled during talking, singing, breathing, and coughing are less than 5 µm in size. CDC recommends using the highest efficiency ventilation filters possible, without having detrimental effects on overall HVAC system performance. ASHRAE, has similar guidance, however, they recommend a minimum filtration efficiency target of MERV 13, provided there are not substantial negative impacts on the HVAC system performance and occupant comfort. A MERV 13 filter is at least 50% efficient at capturing particles in the 0.3 µm to 1.0 µm size range and 85% efficient at capturing particles in the 1 µm to 3 µm size range.  Collectively these particles are capable of remaining airborne for hours and are most associated with deep lung penetration. A MERV 14 filter is at least 75% and 90% efficient, respectively, at capturing those same particles. Efficiencies for MERV 15 and MERV 16 filters are even higher. Thus, the recommended filters are significantly more efficient at capturing particles of concern than a typical MERV 8 filter, which is only around 20% efficient in the 1 µm to 3 µm size range and is not rated for capture efficiency of the smaller 0.3 µm to 1.0 µm particles.Increasing filtration efficiency can increase the pressure drop across the filters. This can lead to increased fan energy, reduced airflow rates, and/or issues controlling indoor temperature and relative humidity levels. Scientific developments in filter design have reduced the amount of the increased pressure drop and its resulting impact on HVAC operations, but not all filters have adopted the newer technology. Prior to a filtration upgrade, the specific filter under consideration should be investigated for its pressure drop ratings at the flow rate(s) of intended use and the potential impacts of that pressure drop evaluated against the capabilities of the existing HVAC system.High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are even more efficient at filtering human-generated infectious particles than MERV 16 filters. However, outside of a few unique applications, HEPA filters are rarely used in central HVAC systems.

      "answer": "Directional Airflow is a protective ventilation concept where air movement flows in a clean-to-less-clean direction. This ventilation concept is applied to areas where the “clean” environment requires a higher level of protection and/or where the “less-clean” environment has a higher risk of containing airborne contaminants (activities or occupancy by individuals with a higher risk of being infectious). Examples of “clean” spaces might include healthcare facility triage stations or rooms/corridors adjacent to higher risk activities. Examples of “less-clean” spaces might include spaces that contain known/suspect infectious persons or spaces where a known activity has increased likelihood of generating infectious airborne particles.The creation of directional airflow can be accomplished within a particular space or between two adjacent spaces. This can be done passively, through intentional placement of supply and exhaust heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) grills or by the intentional creation of pressure differentials between adjacent spaces through specification of offset exhaust and supply air flow rates. Creation of the directional airflow can also be done actively, through the use of fans exhausting through open windows, strategic placement of ductwork attached to portable HEPA filtration units, or dedicated exhaust systems (installed or portable) that generate a desired airflow by exhausting air out of windows, doorways, or through temporary ducts.  In specific settings, specialized local control ventilation interventions that establish the desired airflow directions can also be used (see the [NIOSH Ventilated Headboard](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/04/14/ventilated-headboard/)).Directional airflows must be evaluated carefully. Testing of the directional airflow effectiveness can be accomplished using visual tracer techniques that use “smoke tubes” or handheld “fog generators.” Other tools, such electronic monitors or visual aids to monitor pressure differences can be used when directional airflow is established between two adjacent spaces. To reduce the potential for directing airflow from infectious towards non-infectious space occupants, it is important that the “clean” and “less-clean” space determinations be established using infection control risk assessment considerations.",

      "answer": "Research shows that the particle size of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is around 0.1 micrometer (µm). However, the virus generally does not travel through the air by itself. These viral particles are human-generated, so the virus is trapped in respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei (dried respiratory droplets) that are larger. Most of the respiratory droplets and particles exhaled during talking, singing, breathing, and coughing are less than 5 µm in size. By definition, a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is at least 99.97% efficient at capturing particles 0.3 µm in size. This 0.3 µm particle approximates the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) through the filter. HEPA filters are even more efficient at capturing particles larger \n\n**and**\n\n smaller than the MPPS. Thus, HEPA filters are no less than 99.97% efficient at capturing human-generated viral particles associated with SARS-CoV-2.Portable HEPA filtration units that combine a HEPA filter with a powered fan system are a great option for auxiliary air cleaning, especially in higher risk settings such as health clinics, medical testing locations, workout rooms, or public waiting areas. Other settings that could benefit from portable HEPA filtration can be identified using typical risk assessment parameters, such as community incidence rates, facemask compliance expectations and room occupant density. In choosing a portable HEPA unit, you want to select a system that is appropriately sized for the area in which it is installed. One way to do this for room air cleaners is to select a HEPA fan system with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) [See \n[EPA’s Guide To Air Cleaners In The Home](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf)\n\n] that meets or exceeds the square footage of the room in which it will be used. The larger the CADR, the faster it will clean the room air. If the room in which the air cleaner will be used is taller than 8 feet, choose an air cleaner with a proportionally higher CADR than that based simply on square footage. While these systems do not bring in outdoor dilution air, they are very effective at cleaning air within spaces to reduce the concentration of airborne particulates, including SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Thus, they give effective air exchanges without the need for conditioning outdoor air.HEPA fan systems can be used as stand-alone units, or many larger units allow flexible ductwork to be attached to the air inlet and/or outlet (note that larger ducted units don’t fall under the “room air cleaner” description and may not have a CADR rating). Using ductwork and placing the HEPA system strategically in the space can help provide desired clean-to-less-clean airflow patterns where needed. Ducted HEPA systems can also be used to establish direct source capture interventions for patient treatment and /or testing scenarios (See CDC/NIOSH discussion on \n[Ventilated Headboard](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/healthcare/engcontrolsolutions/ventilated-headboard.html)\n\n). Depending on the size of the HEPA fan/filter units and how the facility in which they are being used is configured, multiple small portable HEPA units deployed to high risk areas may be more useful than one large HEPA unit serving a combined space.\n**[]()Example 2:**\n\n  The room described in \n[Example 1](#refexample1)\n\n is now augmented with a portable HEPA air cleaning device with a CADR of 145 cfm (Q\nhepa\n\n = 145 cfm). The added air movement within the room improves overall mixing, so assign k = 3. How much time is saved to achieve the same 99% reduction in airborne contaminants by adding the portable HEPA device to the room?The addition of the HEPA filter device provides additional clean air to the room.  Here, the clean volumetric air flow rate (Q) is:  Q = Q\ne\n\n + Q\nhepa\n\n = 72 cfm + 145 cfm = 217 cfm.ACH = [Q x 60] / (room volume) = (217 cfm x 60) / (12’ x 10’ x 9’) = 13,020/1080 = 12.06 ACH (round down to 12).Using \n[Table B.1](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html)\n\n, the perfect mixing wait time based on 12 ACH and a 99% reduction of airborne particles is 23 minutes.Using the mixing factor of 3, the estimated wait time for 99% reduction of airborne contaminants in the room is 3 x 23 = 69 minutes.  Thus, the increased ACH and lower k value associated with the portable HEPA filtration unit reduced the wait time from the original 5 hours and 45 minutes to only 1 hour and 9 minutes, \nsaving a total of 4 hours and 36 minutes\n\n before the room can be safely reoccupied.In conclusion, adding the portable HEPA unit increased the effective ventilation rate and improved room air mixing, resulting in an 80% reduction in time for the room to be cleared of potentially-infectious airborne particles.",

      "answer": "CDC does not provide recommendations for, or against, any manufacturer or product. There are numerous devices being heavily marketed to provide air cleaning during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the most common are ionization and/or dry hydrogen peroxide devices. Some devices even include both technologies. While variations of these technologies have been around for decades, relative to other air cleaning or disinfection technologies, they have a less-documented track record when it comes to cleaning/disinfecting large and fast volumes of moving air within heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems or even inside individual rooms. This does not necessarily imply the technologies do not work as advertised. However, in the absence of an established body of peer-reviewed evidence showing proven efficacy and safety under as-used conditions, the technologies are still considered by many to be “emerging.” As with all emerging technologies, consumers are encouraged to exercise caution and to do their homework. Consumers should research the technology, attempting to match any specific claims against the intended use of the product. Consumers should request testing data that quantitively demonstrates a clear protective benefit and occupant safety under conditions consistent with the intended use. Preferably, the documented performance data under as-used conditions should be available from multiple sources, some of which should be independent, third party sources. Unsubstantiated claims of performance or limited case studies with only one device in one room and no reference controls should be questioned. At a minimum, if you are considering the acquisition and use of these devices, you will want to be sure the equipment meets UL 867 standard certification (Standard for Electrostatic Air Cleaners) for production of acceptable levels of ozone, or preferably UL 2998 standard certification (Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP) for Zero Ozone Emissions from Air Cleaners) which is intended to validate that no ozone is produced.\n\n### Preguntas frecuentes relativas a la prevención y el control de infecciones asociadas a la atención médica para el COVID-19",

      "answer": "Sí. Para mantener la salud y la seguridad de los pacientes y del personal de atención médica (HCP), la guía de los CDC para la prevención y el control de infecciones se aplica a todos los entornos donde se ofrece atención médica. Sin embargo, como con cualquier guía, los establecimientos pueden adaptar ciertas recomendaciones a sus entornos. Por ejemplo, la atención siquiátrica con internación puede incluir experiencias colectivas y actividades grupales que quizás precisen continuar. Si es así, la adaptación de estas actividades podría ser necesaria para alinearlas con las recomendaciones del \n[distanciamiento social](https://espanol.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html)\n\n. Podría no ser seguro o adecuado implementar otras medidas recomendadas para el control de infecciones (por ejemplo, asegurar el acceso a desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol, agrupar a pacientes con COVID-19 y asignarles personal dedicado solo a ellos, o implementar medidas universales de control de fuente) en todos los lugares o para todos los pacientes debido a cuestiones de seguridad y comportamiento.Los desafíos y soluciones potenciales que son específicos a los entornos de salud conductual podrían incluir lo siguiente:\n\nAgrupamiento\n**Desafío:**Para prevenir la transmisión, generalmente se recomienda que los pacientes con COVID-19 sean transferidos a un área separada del establecimiento en donde puedan atenderlos HCP dedicados solo a ellos. Debido a problemas de seguridad o necesidades de atención especializada, tal vez no sea posible agrupar a ciertos pacientes o cambiar al HCP asignado para su atención.**Soluciones potenciales:**Cuando el agrupamiento no sea posible, implementar medidas para mantener el distanciamiento social (al menos 6 pies) entre los pacientes con COVID-19 y las otras personas en la unidad. Idealmente, esto incluiría un baño separado para los pacientes con COVID-19. Asegurarse de que el HCP use [todo el equipo de protección personal (EPP) recomendado](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html) cuando atienda a  pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado.\n\nSesiones de terapia grupal\n**Desafío:** Las sesiones de consejería, terapia y discusión grupales son un componente esencial del tratamiento y planes de atención siquiátricos, pero la configuración tradicional para estas actividades no es compatible con las recomendaciones del distanciamiento social.**Soluciones potenciales:** Cuando sea posible, utilizar métodos virtuales o reducir el tamaño de los grupos para que se pueda mantener el distanciamiento social. En el caso de que haya transmisión del COVID-19 en el establecimiento, se deberán interrumpir las sesiones o pasar a un formato de foro de discusión en video hasta que se hayan implementado medidas adicionales de prevención de infecciones para detener la propagación.\n\nCubiertas de tela para la cara\n**Desafío: **En el caso de algunos pacientes, el uso de cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarillas podría presentar un peligro adicional o causar aflicción. Es posible que algunos pacientes no puedan o no quieran usarlas de la forma prevista. Las tiras elásticas o de tela pueden ser usadas para estrangularse a sí mismo o a otros, y los puentes nasales de metal pueden ser usados para lastimarse o como un arma.**Soluciones potenciales:**Pensar en la posibilidad de permitir el uso de cubiertas de tela para la cara o mascarillas —preferentemente las que tengan tiras cortas para atrás de las orejas en lugar de cintas largas— a los pacientes que tengan un bajo riesgo de utilizarlas de un modo indebido. Pensar en la posibilidad de usar cubiertas de tela para la cara o mascarillas durante las actividades grupales supervisadas. Asegurarse de que el HCP use protección para los ojos y una mascarilla cuando interactúe con pacientes que no puedan usar una cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarilla (o, si se trata de un paciente con COVID-19 presunto, asegurarse de que el HCP use un respirador).\n\nDesinfectante de manos a base de alcohol\n**Desafío:** Si bien los desinfectantes de manos que contienen entre un 60 y un 95 % de alcohol son una herramienta importante para la adhesión a las recomendaciones para la [higiene de las manos](https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html), estos desinfectantes deben usarse con cuidado en los establecimientos siquiátricos para asegurarse de que los pacientes no los ingieran.**Soluciones potenciales: **Pensar en la posibilidad de no ubicar los desinfectantes de mano a base de alcohol en las habitaciones de pacientes en establecimientos siquiátricos, ni en los lugares a los que los pacientes tienen acceso sin supervisión. Fomentar el lavado frecuente de las manos con agua y jabón tanto en los pacientes como en el HCP. Pensar en la posibilidad de proveerle al HCP dispensadores personales de bolsillo de desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol.\n\nComer en comedores\n**Desafío:** Como parte del distanciamiento social, generalmente no se recomienda que las comidas se sirvan en comedores. Sin embargo, es necesario seguir supervisando a los pacientes mientras comen debido al potencial de que se lastimen a sí mismos con los cubiertos y porque los medicamentos siquiátricos que se usan comúnmente pueden causar efectos secundarios (p. ej., discinesia tardía, disfagia, hipersalivación e hiposalivación) que aumentan el riesgo de atragantamiento de los pacientes.**Soluciones potenciales:** Una opción es colocar a miembros del personal en las habitaciones de los pacientes para que los supervisen mientras coman. Otra opción es permitir que los pacientes coman en el comedor por turnos para que el personal los pueda supervisar, asegurándose al mismo tiempo de que mantengan como mínimo 6 pies entre ellos. Una tercera opción es hacer que los pacientes se sienten en sillas que estén adecuadamente separadas en el pasillo, afuera de sus habitaciones, para que puedan ser supervisados mientras coman.\n\nFumar\n**Desafío:**Una mayor proporción de pacientes siquiátricos fuman cigarrillos en comparación con la población general. Los pacientes podrían reunirse en espacios al aire libre para fumadores sin practicar el distanciamiento social adecuado.**Soluciones potenciales: **Limitar la cantidad permitida de pacientes que accedan al mismo tiempo a los espacios para fumadores, o colocar a miembros del personal para que observen a los pacientes y se aseguren de que estén practicando el distanciamiento físico adecuado.",

La transmisión de aerosoles a larga distancia, tal como se ve en el sarampión, no ha sido una característica del SARS-CoV-2.Las potenciales vías de transmisión a corta distancia incluyen las salpicaduras y el rociado de material infeccioso a las membranas mucosas y la inhalación de viriones infecciosos exhalados por una persona infectada. La contribución relativa de cada una de estas vías no se conoce para el SARS-Co-V-2.Las mascarillas que comúnmente se usan durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos proveerán una barrera de protección contra el contacto entre el rocío de gotitas y las membranas mucosas de la nariz y la boca, pero no están diseñadas para proteger al que las usa contra la inhalación de partículas pequeñas. Los respiradores con nivel de filtrado N95 o superior — como otros respiradores con mascarilla de filtrado desechables, los respiradores purificadores de aire forzado (PAPR) y los respiradores elastoméricos — proveen tanto una barrera como protección respiratoria debido a sus características de filtrado y de buen ajuste.Los respiradores deberían usarse como parte de un programa de protección que le provea al personal evaluaciones médicas, capacitación y pruebas de ajuste.Aunque las mascarillas se usen rutinariamente para la atención médica de pacientes con infecciones respiratorias virales comunes, los respiradores de nivel N95 o superior se recomiendan de forma habitual para los patógenos emergentes como el SARS-Co-V-2, que tienen el potencial de transmisión vía partículas pequeñas, la capacidad de causar infecciones graves y para los cuales no hay tratamientos específicos o vacunas.Las recomendaciones de los CDC reconocen los desafíos actuales en relación con los suministros de respiradores N95 y otros. Los establecimientos que no tengan suministros suficientes de respiradores N95 y otros para toda la atención médica de pacientes deberían priorizar su uso para las actividades y los procedimientos que suponen el riesgo de generar aerosoles infecciosos y usar las mascarillas para la atención médica que no conlleve tales actividades o procedimientos.

Cuando sea transportado, el paciente deberá usar una mascarilla o una cubierta de tela para la cara para contener las secreciones y estar cubierto con una sábana limpia.Si el personal a cargo del transporte debe preparar al paciente para su traslado (p. ej., transferirlo a una silla de ruedas o a una camilla), este personal debe usar [todo el EPP recomendado](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html) (guantes, bata, protección respiratoria —que como mínimo tenga el nivel de protección de un respirador con mascarilla de filtrado N95 desechable de ajuste comprobado, certificado por NIOSH o, si no hay un respirador disponible, una mascarilla— y protección para los ojos, es decir, gafas de protección o un protector facial desechable que cubra el frente y los costados de la cara). Esta recomendación es necesaria porque estas interacciones generalmente incluyen un contacto cercano, a menudo cara a cara, con el paciente en un espacio cerrado (p. ej., la habitación del paciente). Una vez que el paciente haya sido transferido a la silla de ruedas o a la camilla (y antes de salir de la habitación), las personas que lo transporten deben quitarse la bata, los guantes y la protección para los ojos, e higienizarse las manos.Al personal de atención médica que transporta pacientes con infecciones respiratorias no se le recomienda generalmente que use EPP si el paciente estará usando una mascarilla o cubierta de tela para la cara cuando lo transporten desde su habitación hasta el lugar de destino. Sin embargo, debido a las actuales limitaciones en los conocimientos sobre el COVID-19 y siguiendo el enfoque cauteloso actual de [estratificación del riesgo y monitoreo del personal de atención médica que se ocupe de pacientes con COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html), se recomienda que quienes realicen el transporte usen una mascarilla para todo lo que implique más que un breve encuentro con pacientes con COVID-19. No se debe requerir EPP adicional a menos de que se prevea la necesidad de suministrar asistencia médica durante el transporte (p. ej., ayudar al paciente a remplazar una mascarilla que se le haya salido).Después de llegar a su destino, el personal que reciba al paciente (p. ej., en radiología) y la persona que realizó el transporte (si ayuda con la transferencia) deben higienizarse las manos y usar [todo el EPP recomendado](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html). Si todavía está usando la mascarilla o el respirador original, la persona que transportó al paciente debe ser cuidadosa para evitar contaminarse a sí misma al ponerse el resto del EPP recomendado. Este enfoque cauteloso se perfeccionará y actualizará a medida que se disponga de más información y las necesidades de respuesta cambien en los Estados Unidos.La guía interina para el personal de servicios médicos de emergencia que transporte a pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto está [disponible aquí](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-for-ems.html). El personal de servicios médicos de emergencia debe usar todo el EPP recomendado porque está suministrando atención médica directa y en contacto cercano con el paciente por periodos más prolongados.",

Si un paciente se presenta para ser atendido y no se sospecha que tenga COVID-19 (según los síntomas y antecedentes de exposición), el HCP deberá tomar las \n[medidas de precaución estándar](https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/recommendations/core-practices.html)\n\n (y las \n[precauciones por transmisión](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)\n\n si es necesario, con base en el diagnóstico presunto). También deberá:\nUsar protección para los ojos además de la mascarilla para garantizar que los ojos, la nariz y la boca estén protegidos de las salpicaduras y rociados de material infeccioso de otras personas.Usar un respirador N95 o de nivel superior, en lugar de una mascarilla, para los siguientes casos:\n\n*   Procedimientos que generan aerosoles (ver la sección de [preguntas y respuestas sobre cuáles procedimientos son considerados como generadores de aerosoles en entornos de atención médica](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-faq.html#procedures-aerosol)) y\n\n*   Los procedimientos quirúrgicos que podrían presentar un mayor riesgo de transmisión si el paciente tiene COVID-19 (p. ej., que generan aerosoles potencialmente infecciosos o incluyen regiones anatómicas donde las cargas virales podrían ser más altas, como la nariz y la garganta, orofaringe, aparato respiratorio) (ver las [preguntas frecuentes relativas a cirugías](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-faq.html#surgical) abajo).Los respiradores con válvulas de exhalación no se recomiendan para el control de fuente y no deben usarse durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos ya que el aliento exhalado sin filtrar comprometería el campo estéril.\n\n*   En el caso del HCP que trabaje en áreas con transmisión comunitaria mínima o inexistente, son opcionales las recomendaciones universales de protección para los ojos y un respirador (descrito antes) correspondientes a áreas con transmisión comunitaria de moderada a considerable.  Sin embargo, el HCP debe continuar usando protección para los ojos o un respirador N95 o de nivel superior toda vez que se recomiende para la atención de pacientes como parte de las medidas de precaución estándar o por transmisión. Se recomienda al HCP el uso universal de una mascarilla para el control de fuente.\n\nEn función de la disponibilidad de pruebas y de la rapidez con que se puedan conseguir los resultados, los establecimientos también pueden tener en cuenta la implementación de pruebas de detección del COVID-19 durante el proceso de admisión o antes de un procedimiento. Los resultados de las pruebas podrían fundamentar las decisiones para el uso universal de protección para los ojos y respiradores, según lo indicado antes, especialmente si hay escasez de EPP. Las limitaciones presentadas por el uso de esta estrategia (hacer pruebas) incluye la obtención de resultados negativos en pacientes que estén en el periodo de incubación y que luego se tornen infecciosos, y los resultados falsos negativos, según sea el método de análisis utilizado.Definiciones:\n\n*   [Transmisión comunitaria considerable](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/framework-non-COVID-care.html): transmisión comunitaria a gran escala, como en entornos comunitarios (p. ej., escuelas, lugares de trabajo)\n\n*   Transmisión comunitaria de mínima a moderada: transmisión sostenida con gran probabilidad de exposición, o exposición confirmada, dentro de los entornos comunitarios y potencial para el aumento rápido de casos.\n\n*   Transmisión comunitaria mínima o inexistente: evidencia de casos aislados o de transmisión comunitaria limitada, investigaciones de casos en marcha; no hay evidencia de exposición en un entorno comunitario de grandes dimensiones.",

      "answer": "Algunos procedimientos que se les realiza a los pacientes tienen más probabilidad de generar concentraciones más altas de aerosoles respiratorios infecciosos, que las que se producen al toser, estornudar, hablar o respirar. Estos procedimientos generadores de aerosoles (AGP, por sus siglas en inglés) ponen al personal de atención médica y a otras personas potencialmente en mayor riesgo de exposición a patógenos e infección.No ha sido posible crear una lista exhaustiva de los AGP para los entornos de atención médica debido a las limitaciones en los datos disponibles en cuanto a cuáles procedimientos podrían generar aerosoles potencialmente infecciosos, y a las dificultades para determinar si las transmisiones reportadas durante los AGP se debieron a aerosoles o a otras exposiciones.No hay consenso de expertos ni suficientes datos de respaldo para crear una lista definitiva y exhaustiva de los AGP para los entornos de atención médica.Los procedimientos médicos realizados comúnmente, que con frecuencia son considerados como AGP, incluyen:\n\n*   succión abierta de vías respiratorias\n\n*   inducción de esputo\n\n*   reanimación cardiopulmonar\n\n*   intubación y extubación endotraqueal\n\n*   ventilación no invasiva (p. ej., BiPAP, CPAP)\n\n*   broncoscopia\n\n*   ventilación manualCon base en los limitados datos disponibles, no se sabe con certeza si podrían ser infecciosos los aerosoles generados por algunos procedimientos, como, por ejemplo:\n\n*   administración de medicamentos por nebulizador*\n\n*   administración de oxígeno de alto flujo*Los aerosoles generados por los nebulizadores se derivan del medicamento en el nebulizador.

      "answer": "Si bien se cree que la propagación del SARS-CoV-2 se produce principalmente a través de las gotitas respiratorias, la contribución de pequeñas partículas respirables a la transmisión por la gran proximidad actualmente es incierta. La transmisión por vía aérea de persona a persona a grandes distancias es poco probable.La cantidad de tiempo que el aire adentro de la sala de atención de pacientes permanece potencialmente infeccioso es desconocida y podría depender de un número de factores que incluyen el tamaño de la sala, la cantidad de cambios de aire por hora, cuánto tiempo el paciente estuvo en la sala, si el paciente estuvo tosiendo o estornudando, y si se realizó un procedimiento que generó aerosoles. Los establecimientos de atención médica tendrán que considerar estos factores al decidir cuándo alguien que no esté usando EPP puede entrar en la sala desocupada.En el caso de un paciente que no estuvo tosiendo ni estornudando, no fue sometido a un procedimiento que generó aerosoles, y ocupó la sala por un corto periodo (p. ej., unos minutos), cualquier riesgo para el personal de atención médica y los pacientes subsiguientes probablemente se disipará en una cuestión de minutos. Sin embargo, en el caso de un paciente que estuvo tosiendo y que se quedó en la sala por un largo periodo, o fue sometido a un procedimiento que generó aerosoles, el periodo de riesgo probablemente sea más largo.Para estas situaciones de mayor riesgo, es razonable aplicar un periodo similar al que se usa en el caso de la propagación de patógenos por vía aérea (p. ej., sarampión, tuberculosis) y restringir el ingreso de personal de atención médica y de pacientes sin EPP a la sala hasta que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas.Hay disponible una guía general sobre [tasas de remoción bajo condiciones de ventilación diversas](/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html#tableb1).Además de asegurarse de que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas, el personal de atención médica debe limpiar y desinfectar las superficies ambientales y el equipo compartido antes de que la sala sea usada para otro paciente.",

En la mayoría de las situaciones, un proveedor de atención médica expuesto no puede recordar todos los contactos que tuvo en los 10 días previos. Además, debido a que datos recientes parecen indicar que las personas asintomáticas en el momento del diagnóstico podrían tener una carga viral más baja que la de las personas sintomáticas, los recursos adicionales requeridos podrían desviar los recursos para la investigación de casos y el rastreo de contactos de las actividades que tienen más probabilidad de interrumpir la transmisión en curso.\n\nEl rastreo de contacto se recomienda por lo general para cualquier persona que haya tenido un contacto cercano prolongado con la persona con COVID-19 durante estos periodos.

      "answer": "Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with \n[social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html)\n\n recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns.Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include:\n\nCohorting\n**Challenge:** To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care.**Potential Solutions:** When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear [all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\n\nGroup Therapy Sessions\n**Challenge**: Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations.**Potential Solutions**: When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.\n\nCloth Face Coverings\n**Challenge: **For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon.**Potential Solutions:** Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).\n\nAlcohol-based Hand Sanitizer\n**Challenge**: While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to [hand hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html) recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients.**Potential Solutions: **Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP.\n\nDining\n**Challenge**: As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients.**Potential Solutions**: One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.\n\nSmoking\n**Challenge:** A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing.**Potential Solutions: **Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spaces at the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.",

The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission.The facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make this information available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available.",

      "answer": "As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying \n[Standard Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)\n\n. HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed.To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:\n\n*   consider nonoperative approaches when feasible;\n\n*   minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible;\n\n*   minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures;\n\n*   use the [extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/framework-non-COVID-care.html) to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and\n\n*   implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.\n\nIf surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all \n[recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html)\n\n.  This includes:\n\nUsing all recommended PPE: an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.\nRespirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field.If shortages exist, N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).\n\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are infected but do not have symptoms, some infected individuals will not be identified by screening for clinical signs and symptoms.  HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for \n[universal eye protection and respirator use](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html)\n\n.  HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions.In addition to the use of universal PPE and source control in healthcare settings, targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 might be used to identify those with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and further reduce risk for exposures in some healthcare settings. Depending on guidance from local and state health departments, testing availability, and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure diagnostic testing with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays for SARS-CoV-2.Testing results might inform decisions about rescheduling elective procedures or about the need for additional Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for the patient. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used.",

      "answer": "CDC’s guidance to use NIOSH-approved N95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 is based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory viruses.Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2.Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2.Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics.Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines.CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailed [strategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/index.html) are available on the CDC website. Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume.",

      "answer": "In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear [all recommended PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html) (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene.If the patient is wearing a facemask or cloth face covering, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for [risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html), use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear [all recommended PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html). If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-for-ems.html).

      "answer": "Some procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. These aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen exposure and infection.Development of a comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining if reported transmissions during AGPs are due to aerosols or other exposures.There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings.Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include:\n\n*   open suctioning of airways\n\n*   sputum induction\n\n*   cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\n*   endotracheal intubation and extubation\n\n*   non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP)\n\n*   bronchoscopy\n\n*   manual ventilationBased on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as:\n\n*   nebulizer administration*\n\n*   high flow O2 delivery*Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer.

      "answer": "Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely.The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE.For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol-generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to HCP and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer.For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles.General guidance on [clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html#tableb1) is available.In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, HCP should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient.",

Healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible.The use of gowns as part of Contact Precautions in the context of MDROs has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (HCP). Facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic MDROs, such as MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli except as required for \n[Standard Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)\n\n. Facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which MDROs are considered endemic. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.\n\n**Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e.g., **\n\n*Candida auris*\n\n**) that are not considered endemic:  **\n\nRather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of \n[Standard Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)\n\n and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to HCP. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, HCP are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters.  Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.\n\n**Caring for patients with **\n\n*Clostridioides difficile*\n\n** infections (CDI):  **\n\nFacilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient’s room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI.  As part of a \n[supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/prevent/cdi-prevention-strategies.html)\n\n, some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage of \n\n*Clostridioides difficile*\n\n. There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI.

The provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue [Transmission-Based Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html) or [Home Isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html) are met.**If the date of exposure cannot be determined**. For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for COVID-19 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue [Transmission-Based Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html) or [Home Isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html) are met. Although the infectious period is generally accepted to be [10 days after onset of infection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/strategy-discontinue-isolation.html), eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for COVID-19 is likely inefficient.  In most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days.  Also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission.\n\nContact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with COVID-19 during these time periods.  While this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor.Recommended actions for HCP, patients, and visitors:\n\nPerform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other HCP who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these HCP had prolonged, close contact \n\n**and**\n\n what PPE they were wearing.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into someone’s lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads.

Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. They are not personal protective equipment.Cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voices (such as shouting, chanting, singing). Provide all staff with information on [proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). Advise staff that cloth face coverings should not be placed on:\n\n*   Babies or children younger than 2 years old\n\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n\n*   Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance",

      "answer": "First, students with symptoms of COVID-19 should not attend school. Symptoms of asthma and COVID-19 may overlap, including cough and shortness of breath. Therefore, students experiencing acute asthma attacks should not be attending school without approval by a healthcare provider; if an asthma attack starts at school, a student may need a bronchodilator treatment before being sent home or before an ambulance arrives. The American Lung Association’s [Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilators](https://www.lung.org/getmedia/92bd8d3f-c5ca-46c0-9063-9d5719ec690b/model-policy-for-school.pdf.pdf) recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces and nebulizers with disposable tubing with mask/mouthpieces. Inhalers and nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions.During this COVID-19 pandemic, [asthma treatments using inhalers with spacers](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/inhaler_video/default.htm) (with or without face mask,  according to each student’s individualized treatment plan) are preferred over nebulizer treatments whenever possible. Based on limited data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure.Due to limited availability of data, [it is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-faq.html).[1](#ftn1) During this COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask).Use of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Based on limited available data1, forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough.Schools should obtain the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff who administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters to students with asthma. PPE for use when administering nebulizer treatments or peak flow meters to students with asthma consists of gloves, medical or surgical [facemask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/using-ppe.html) and eye protection. School staff should be trained on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, where this PPE is stored, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of used PPE. CDC has [information](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/using-ppe.html) on using PPE. Staff should also be trained on how to administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters.During this COVID-19 pandemic, if a nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter is necessary at school for a student, the number of people present in the room should be limited to the student and the staff member administering the treatment or peak flow meter. If appropriate based on the student’s age and level of maturity, the staff member could leave the room and return when the nebulizer treatment is finished. After the nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter, this room should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. CDC has [information on how to clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/cleaning-disinfecting-decision-tool.html) and [how to prevent asthma attacks triggered by cleaning and disinfecting](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/asthma.html) activities.[People with moderate to severe asthma](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/asthma.html) may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19.

      "answer": "CDC is not aware of data regarding practices to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses, when multiple people share one asthma inhaler.Students should be permitted to use their personal inhaler, as needed, to the extent permitted by state law and school policies. When students need to use of the school’s stock inhaler, the inhaler should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions.

[Limited data from healthcare settings](http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/61/10/1285.full.pdf) suggest wiping all surfaces of an inhaler with an alcohol-based wipe containing at least 70% alcohol after inhaler use, and then allowing these surfaces to air-dry can prevent bacterial cross-contamination. CDC is not aware of data on whether this has helped prevent viral infections or infections in the school setting.CDC is not aware of data regarding viral contamination of spacer devices.

If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering (if tolerated) to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear [all recommended PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html) (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown and gloves and perform hand hygiene.The transporter should continue to wear a respirator or facemask.  The continued use of eye protection by the transporter is also recommended if there is potential that the patient might not be able to tolerate their facemask or cloth face covering for the duration of transport.   Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear [all recommended PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html). If still wearing their original respirator or facemask and eye protection, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE.

If HCP have a [high-risk exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html) within 3 months of their initial infection to a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection, should they be restricted from work for 14 days after the exposure?**\n\nCDC has posted guidance addressing \n[risk assessment and work exclusion for HCP with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html)\n\n. Due to their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals, this guidance recommends conservative management of occupationally exposed HCP.Review of currently available evidence suggests that most individuals do not become re-infected within 3 months of resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Re-infection has not been definitively identified to date. \n[Several studies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html)\n\n have documented persistent detection of virus using PCR after recovery, some even with redevelopment or new symptoms. However, people who were newly symptomatic or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after recent resolution of an acute infection did not appear to be infectious to others. Testing of asymptomatic individuals during this 3-month period is complicated by the fact that some people have detectable virus from their prior infection during this period; a positive test during this period may more likely result from a prior infection rather than a new infection that poses risk for transmission. In light of this, exposed HCP could continue to work, while monitoring for development of symptoms. If symptoms develop, exposed HCP should be assessed and potentially tested for SARS-Cov-2, if an alternate etiology is not identified. Some facilities might still choose to institute work exclusion for HCP following a high-risk exposure.\n\n**2. If HCP within 3 months of their initial infection develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19, should they be excluded from work and retested?**\n\nHCP within 3 months of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be evaluated to identify potential alternative etiologies for their symptoms. If an alternate etiology for the symptoms cannot be identified, they may need to be retested for SARS-CoV-2 infection with the understanding that a positive viral test could represent residual viral particles from the previous infection, rather than new infection. Decisions about the need for and duration of work exclusion should be based upon their suspected diagnosis (e.g., influenza, SARS-CoV-2 infection).\n\n**3. Do HCP within 3 months of their initial infection need to wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection? For example, if there are limited respirators, should respirators be prioritized for HCP who have not been previously infected?**\n\nRegardless of suspected or confirmed immunity, healthcare personnel should always wear \n[all recommended PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html)\n\n when caring for patients. In situations of PPE shortages, facilities should refer to CDC \n[strategies for optimizing PPE supply](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html)\n\n. However, as with other infectious diseases (e.g., measles), allocation of available PPE should not be based on whether HCP have been previously infected or have evidence of immunity.\n\n**4. Should HCP within 3 months of their initial infection be preferentially assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection?**\n\nWhile individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection might develop some protective immunity, the duration and extent of such immunity are not known. Staffing decisions should be based on usual facility practices. Any HCP assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of history of infection, should follow all \n[recommended infection prevention and control practices](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html)\n\n when providing care.

Then the facility should perform serial testing of all residents and HCP who previously tested negative every 3–7 days until no new positive tests have been identified for 14 days. In nursing homes with outbreaks, most cases are identified within the first two weeks of diagnosing the first new case. These early cases likely occur among people who were previously exposed or were infected before more infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in response to the outbreak.For this reason, if testing capacity allows and does not divert staff and resources away from performing other critical IPC measures (e.g., ensuring effective implementation of [Transmission-Based Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) for infected and potentially exposed residents), the facility should consider testing more frequently (e.g., every 3 days) for the first two weeks of the outbreak, then test less frequently (e.g., every 7 days) thereafter until no new cases are identified for 14 days. As an example, testing would occur on day 0 (day the first case is identified), days 3, 6, 9, and 12, and then on days 19, 26, etc.This increased frequency of testing might not be possible in many facilities (e.g., lack of testing supplies or diversion of resources from other patient care activities). A minimum frequency of testing every 7 days is recommended until no new positive tests have been identified for 14 days. The effectiveness of increased frequency of testing is substantially diminished if IPC measures are not maintained.

However, [false-positive results](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/faqs.html#Interpreting-Results-of-Diagnostic-Tests) may occur with any test even when sensitivity and specificity are very high, depending on a variety of factors.A point-of-care test should be considered a possible false-positive when a positive test result appears inconsistent with the clinical situation (e.g., a positive antigen test in an asymptomatic person who does not have risk factors and resides in a community with lower COVID-19 prevalence). When a false-positive test is suspected, nursing homes and health departments should also review and gather the following information:\n\n*   Review the [FDA EUA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas#individual-antigen) and instructions for use of the point-of-care antigen test to ensure correct use. For instance, the use of viral transport medium has been shown to produce false-positive results and should not be used for some antigen platforms (including BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia platforms).\n\n*   Review recent control results to ensure accuracy of the antigen test machine. If able, perform procedural quality control tests to ensure correct operation of the machine.\n\n*   Compare the percent positivity of the samples that were run that day (or week) to their previous percent positivity (e.g., their rolling 7-day average percent positive). Identifying many positives in one day might indicate an issue with the antigen results (either due to operator error or test supplies).\n\n*   Consider the pre-test probability of disease. If testing a population with a COVID-19 prevalence of <1% (e.g., screening asymptomatic HCP in non-outbreak settings) with a single test with 99% specificity, the positive predictive value (probability that a positive test is a true-positive) could be <40%. If the prevalence is >10% (e.g., testing asymptomatic residents and HCP as part of an outbreak response) with that same test with 99% specificity, the positive predictive value may be >90%.

However, viral RNA can be persistently detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract samples in some persons after apparent clinical recovery.  In some persons, after testing negative by RT-PCR in two consecutive samples, later samples can test positive again. These persistent detections of viral RNA usually are associated with higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., fewer RNA copies) than Ct values found in RT-PCR results from samples collected shortly before or during clinical illness. Studies that have examined how long SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in adults have demonstrated that, in some persons, it can be detected for weeks.",

      "answer": "Whether the presence of detectable but low concentrations of viral RNA after clinical recovery represents the presence of potentially infectious virus is unknown. Based on experience with other viruses, it is unlikely that such persons pose an important infectious risk to others. However, whether this is true for SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been definitively established.After the onset of illness, the detectable viral burden usually declines. After a week or more, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin becomes detectable and then antibody levels increase. Some of these antibodies may prevent the virus from infecting cells in cell culture. A decline in viral RNA is associated with a decreased ability to isolate live virus. For most patients with COVID-19, efforts to isolate live virus from upper respiratory tract specimens have been unsuccessful when specimens are collected more than 10 days after illness onset. Recovery of live virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19; in some cases, these persons were in an immunocompromised state.Persons who have tested persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA have, in some cases, had their signs and symptoms of COVID-19 improve. When viral isolation in tissue culture has been attempted in such persons in South Korea and the United States, live virus has not been isolated. There is no evidence to date that clinically recovered persons with persistent or recurrent detection of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others.Despite these observations, it’s not possible to conclude that all persons with persistent or recurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are no longer infectious. There is no firm evidence that the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective. If these antibodies are protective, it’s not known what antibody levels are needed to  protect against reinfection.These data and experience with other viral respiratory infections indicate that most persons recovered from COVID-19 who test persistently or recurrently positive by RT-PCR are likely no longer infectious. Isolation and precautions may be discontinued for persons with COVID-19  10 days after symptom onset (the date on which symptoms first began, including non-respiratory symptoms), provided their fever has resolved for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and their other symptoms have improved. For some persons with [severe or critical illness, or who are severely immunocompromised](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html#twenty-days), [isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html) and [precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html) may be maintained for up to 20 days after symptom onset.",

Some of the strategies used to slow the spread of disease in communities include postponing or cancelling non-urgent elective procedures and using telemedicine instead of face-to-face encounters for routine medical visits.Different strategies are needed to ensure the delivery of newborn care and well-child care, including childhood immunizations. Healthcare providers in communities affected by COVID-19 are using \n[strategies to separate well visits from sick visits](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/covid-19-clinical-guidance-q-a/)\n\n. Examples include:\n\n*   Scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon.\n\n*   Separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits.\n\n*   Collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children.\n\nBecause of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well-child care, including immunizations, for all patients in their practice. \n\n**If a practice can provide only limited well-child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible**\n\n.

Efficacy of the applied dose (a function of irradiance and time) is highly dependent on many factors, such as the concentration of the virus, inoculum size (in experimental studies), the virus medium, contours and type of material being treated, as well as what the virus is suspended in (e.g., culture media, respiratory droplets, other proteinaceous material). These complex variables may explain the range of results presented in the published literature.\n\n*   For more information on these technologies see the CDC Business FAQs under the heading “[Cleaning and Disinfection in the Workplace](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/general-business-faq.htm)”\n\n*   UV-C can be applied on healthcare environmental surfaces using robots as NTDs following terminal cleaning and is still considered investigational; one study mentioned above the [Duke BETR Disinfection Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6487496/pdf/nihms-1025214.pdf) (Andersen DJ, et al.

N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.\n\n*   Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.\n\n*   Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace.\n\n*   When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media.\n\n*   Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.\n\n*   The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.",
